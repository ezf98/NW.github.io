		I love you not for how you shine,<br>
        But for the soul that feels like mine.<br>
        For every thought, each tender part,<br>
		The way you speak straight to the heart.<br>
       <br>
		Your skincare rituals, soft and slow,<br>
		Your fashion sense, your steady glow.<br>
		Your love for purple, cool and rare<br>
		Like dusk caught gently in your hair.<br>
        <br>
		You talk of movies and anime,<br>
		And light the room in your own way.<br>
		You carry strength and quiet grace,<br>
		And beauty lives in your embrace.<br>
        <br>
		You doubt yourself, I see it clear.<br>
		But let me be the voice you hear<br>
		That tells you, love, you’re more than “fine,”<br>
		You’re unique, and bright, and wholly mine.<br>
        <br>
		Not mine to keep or shape or mold,<br>
		But mine to cherish, fierce and bold.<br>
		To lift you up when days feel long,<br>
		To be your calm, to be your song.<br>
        <br>
		I’ll cheer you on when you can’t stand,<br>
		And hold your dreams with steady hands.<br>
		You are enough, you’ve come so far<br>
		And I love you, Lapochka, just as you are.<br>
